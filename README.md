# WGU-Capstone-Project

This was my Capstone Project for WGU. The purpose of this program is to use medical readings and Artificial Intelligence to determine if the patient shows signs of Parkinson's Disease. This includes my Proposal for an AI project and my documentation for the project. This project was written in Python.

This project uses XGBoosting, or eXtreme Gradient Boosting, algorithm for machine learning. This algorithm provides a 94% accuracy. I have included some test data to plug in and test the program out.
